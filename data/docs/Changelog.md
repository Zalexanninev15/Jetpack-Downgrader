# Changelog of Jetpack Downgrader

## [Release] Jetpack Downgrader Version 2.2

#### Meet version 2.2! [A lot of changes have been made](https://github.com/Zalexanninev15/Jetpack-Downgrader/commit/5a54deb5efc9bd33889acb01e9246f5838c907be), so the update is necessary for everyone! I recommend a clean unpacking, without updating the previous version

#### 👉 GUI Version 1.2.3.3 | Changes:

- Added the About window
- The system of settings and localizations has been rewritten. Files and code have become much easier and more convenient to edit and read
- A huge number of edits have been made
- The GitHub icon has been replaced with a help icon (analogous to pressing the **F1** key)
- Improved optimization for x64
- Updated localizations and:  
  ~ Added more translatable strings  
  ~ Added a translation display from the selected localization (before its application) for the localization selection window when the application is first launched  
  ~ Removed outdated dependencies
- Fixed the problem with false antivirus results (possibly temporarily)
- Fixed a bug when rolling back the game version 1.0, if the backup file is equal in hash to the used file version 1.0
- Fixed a bug displaying the window size with the choice of language when the application is first launched
- Fixed a bug with the language selection panel when downloading files or after the Downgrader is finished
- Removed unnecessary and outdated code

#### 👉 Downgrader Version 1.15.0.2 | Changes:

- The system of settings has been rewritten. Files and code have become much easier and more convenient to edit and read
- Improved user interaction
- Improved startup optimization
- Minor improvements
- Fixed the problem with false antivirus results
- Removed unnecessary and outdated code + removed outdated settings (if you are going to use the Downgrader separately from the GUI, the [documentation for deleted functions](https://github.com/Zalexanninev15/Jetpack-Downgrader/blob/unstable/data/docs/DowngraderSettingsOld.md) is left unchanged)

## [Release] Jetpack Downgrader Version 2.1

- Added a button to close the application after the end of the downgrade
- Algorithm for storing settings has been changed. Now the folder is not clogged **C:\Users%username%\AppData\Local**. Check the path **C:\Users%username%\AppData\Local\Zalexanninev15** and delete this folder
- Functionality of showing progress on the taskbar in Windows has been completely rewritten. Now additional libraries are not required (which has slightly reduced the size of the overall project release), the native WinAPI is used instead
- Updated localizations + fixed a bug with the downgrade start button in the Russian localization
- Improving interaction with GUI
- General improvements and edits

## [Release] Jetpack Downgrader Version 2.0

#### As promised, here is a new version, this time with a graphical interface and a lot of new features. It took a really long time (2.5 months), but now I'm ready to present you a new version! 🎉 🥂 🥳 | [Official post in VK (RU)](https://vk.com/wall-119683810_15357)

#### Changes

- Added a full-featured graphical interface-launcher with a huge number of settings for the downgrader and the game
- The size of the patches has decreased for the second time! From 884 MB to 517 MB. For the first time, something like this happened in [version 1.10](https://github.com/Zalexanninev15/Jetpack-Downgrader/releases/tag/1.10-PublicBeta), in which the patch size changed from 1.75 GB to 884 MB
- The overall process of downgrading the game version has been significantly improved, everything has become faster and more stable. Many actions have been converted to simple ones or removed altogether
- Changed the format for backups of original files (**bak** to **jpb**)
- Added coloring of all downrader messages in different colors to make it easier to highlight the actions performed/performed, as well as errors and just text
- Added the output of a new path to the game after the end of the work
- If file with settings (jpd.ini) is not found, it will be created automatically with the default values
- Renamed 1 setting. Value of 1 setting was changed, which allowed us to fix various kinds of bugs
- Work has been done to improve the code and optimize it for 64-bit systems
- The version calculation system has been changed, which now does not rely on the version of the downgrader. Now each component (GUI and Downgrader) has its own version, and the general version of the components assembly is recorded in the release based on the list of changes
- Folder with DirectX is not deleted, which allows you not to download the installer again when you re-use the downgrader
- Significantly improved the registration of the game in the system
- A huge number of changes and improvements for both users and code and performance
- Fixed all bugs and errors

## [Unstable Release] Jetpack Downgrader Version 2.0-rc2

#### Improved version of [Release Candidate 1](https://github.com/Zalexanninev15/Jetpack-Downgrader/releases/tag/2.0-rc). Fixed a huge number of errors, bugs and made general improvements to the interface and code. I also added support for modifications in the form of EXE installers. The changes affect many aspects, so I recommend using the new version from scratch. Patches must be downloaded in the GUI itself, there are no separate archives with patches!
